Transformer neural nets are a recent class of neural networks for sequences, based on self-attention, that have been shown to be well adapted to text and are currently driving important progress in natural language processing. Here is the architecture as illustrated in the seminal paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf).
